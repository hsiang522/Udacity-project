boston_housing:  
Build an optimal machine learning model to predict the best selling price for the customerâ€™s house in the Boston metropolitan area based on a statistical analysis of the historical data.

customer_segments:  
Using several clustering techniques in order to help the retailer make more appropriate business decisions for best segment customers into distinct categories.

digit_recognition:  
Build a convolutional neural network model to train the model from MNIST database and predict the handwritten number.

finding_donors:  
Evaluate and optimize several different supervised models to determine which algorithm will provide the highest contribution yield.

smartcab:  
Design an agent that can drive a smart car, and then train it using a reinforcement learning algorithm.
